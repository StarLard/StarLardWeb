# Hi, I'm Caleb ðŸ‘‹

Currently building memes and dreams as an iOS Engineer at Twitch. Previously CTO at Map2Next: a mobile app that provides the fastest way to find great places to go. Prior to joining Map2Next, I worked as an iOS engineer with companies across the US where I created apps which are now being used by thousands of users.
